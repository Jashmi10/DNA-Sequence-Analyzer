# DNA Sequence Analyzer

An interactive tool to analyze DNA sequences and extract meaningful biological information. The project can generate complementary strands, calculate GC content, detect mutations, and identify patterns in the given DNA sequence.

## Key Features

- **Complementary Strand:** Generates the complementary DNA strand for the given sequence.
- **GC Content:** Calculates the GC content percentage of the sequence.
- **Mutation Detection:** Identifies possible mutations within the sequence.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Detects specific motifs or recurring patterns in the DNA sequence.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML & CSS for user-friendly input and display.  
- **Backend:** C++ for DNA sequence analysis and computation.

## Performance Highlights

- Fast and accurate DNA analysis for sequences of varying lengths.  
- Provides real-time outputs based on user input.  
- Easy-to-use interface with clear and informative results.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with genomic databases for comparison.  
- Visualization of DNA sequences and mutations.  
- Advanced pattern recognition for complex motifs.
